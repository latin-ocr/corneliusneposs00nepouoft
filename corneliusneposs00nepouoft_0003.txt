1. PRIMARY ARITHMETIC. 181110. 160 pages. Price 21
cents—This work presupposes no knowledge of Arithmetic. It

commences with Elementary principleS, and lays a sure founda-

tion for what is to follow.

ll. ELEMENTARY ARITHMETIO. 16mo. 347 pag-es. Price
42 cents—From the Primary the pupil proceeds to the Elementary,
in which it is aimed to discipline the mind, to develop the reason-
ing powers, and to prepare the pupil for the advanced departments
of Mathematics. In the author’s treatment of Vulgar F ractions,
Percentage, and Interest, his new method of finding the cash
balance in Equation of Payrnents, and his improved method of
Extracting the Cube Root, he has certainly made a great advance
on the other Elementary Arithmetics now before the public.

111. PRAGTICAL ARITmOETlc. 121116. 356 pageS. Price,
Cloth, 62 cents—This work covers nearly the same ground as the
Elementary, differing from it principally in presenting a greater
