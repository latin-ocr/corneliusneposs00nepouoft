EXERCISE.

The disgrace of this [man's] early manhood· was blot-
ted out by his very great exertions.²--I doubt not that he
will give himself up entirely to literature.³—His mother
was of a noble family.—Themistocles, having squander-
ed' his fortune, was disinherited by his father.—Nor did
he judge less accurately of [what] was present than he
conjectured ably of [what was still] future—Themisto-
cles is going to appear [as an orator] before the assem-
bly of the people.—Thernistocles‚ having blotted-out that ,
disgrace by the greatest exertions,² became distinguished
in a short time.

which long-continued manual labor produces on the palm of the

That it does not necessarily imply long experience, Themistocles
being very young. An acute mind and sound judgment learns its
lessons of practical wisdom in a comparatively short time: expcrience
cannot teach, without intellectual power, to inser the general prinei-
ple from insulated facts.
