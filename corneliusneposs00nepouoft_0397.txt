Eumenes, is, vn„ a native of Cardia, in Thrace, the ablest and most
deserving of the generals of Alexander. After the death of that
hero Eumenes remained steadily attached to the royal family3

Europa, (8,qu Europe, one of the sour great continents into which the
world has been divided. It is situate between 360 and 720 of north
latitudo, and between 100 west and 65Ο east longitude. It extends
in length about 3,300 miles, from the rock of Lisbon in the west,
to the Uralian mountnins in the east ; and in breadth about
2350 miles from the North Cape in Lapland to Cape Matapan,
the southern extremity of Greece. Though the smallest of the
four great divisions of the globe, it sar surpasses them all in politi-
cal importance. Almost wholly situate within the temperate zone,
its climate is peculiarly favorable to the physical and mental en-
ergies of man ς while its numerous and extensive inland scas, sa—
cilitating the intercourse between its various nations, have pro-
moted their mutual progress in knowledge and civilization. It is
here, accordingly, that the human mind has approached nearest
to perfectiori. It is here that learning, science, aud the arts, have
been most successfully cultivated3 that the native freedom and
privileges of men have been most resolutely vindicated, and most
generally recognized, and that governments have been estab-
lished on the firm basis of mutual advantage to the rulers and
the ruled. In consequence os those advantages Europe now gives
laws to the greater partos the globe ; and seems destined to dif
fuse over all the other continents the light of knowledge, refine·
ment, and true religion. Its ancient divisions were Scandinavia,
including Denmark, Norway, Lapland, Firiland, and Sweden3
