EXERCISE.

Pausanias answered more haughtily, and governed
more cruelly, than the Lacedaemonians could endure.
Pausanias not long afterwards withdrew to Colonae,
which is a place in the Troas. It was written on the
scytala, that unless he granted an audience to those who
applied [for it ‚] they would throw him into prison. Γ he
mistocles was of opinion that they should not wait‚ till
Pausanias returned home. The Ephori cannot endure
this, but sent ambassadors to him with the Scytala. Any
one of tle Ephori may throw even oue of their kings into
prison.
