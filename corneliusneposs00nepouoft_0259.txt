crunnus, cn. 111. 24.

EXERCISE ΟΝ CH. 1. 11.

It is certain that Chabrias has fought a battle before
Thebes. It cannot be denied that Chabrias has marched
to the assistance of the Boeotians. The rest of the
main-body would not retire. A statue was erected to
Chabrias, for having taught his men to kneel down
behind their shields and await the charge of the enemy
with a line of pointed spears. Chabrias wished tha*
nis statue should be represented in the [kneeling] pos-
ture, which, by his directions, his men had assumed,
and which had gained them the victory. Iwill not
withdraw till I conquer the whole island.
