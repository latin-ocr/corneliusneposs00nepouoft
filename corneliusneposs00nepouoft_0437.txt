of the text, the illustrations of words, particles, and pronouns, and the explanation
of various points os construction and interpretation, bear witness to the Editor's
familiarity with some of the most important results of modern scholarship, and en-
title his work to a large share os public favor.''

been published in this country, and will be found a valuable aid in their studies to
the lovers of classical literature.”— Troy Daily WIziq,
