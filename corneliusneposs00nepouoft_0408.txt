380 HISTORICAL AND GEOGRAPHICAL INDEX.

tator. Minutius was as rash as Fabius was cautious3 and the
army, dissatisfied with the inactivity in which they were kept by
that able commander, took advantage of his absence at Rome to
procure the advancement of Minutius to equal authority with the
dictator. Minutius rashly hazarded a battle with Hannibal3 and
it was only by the unexpected arrival of Fabius that his army
was saved from destruction. He acknowledged his error, and ever
after submittedimplicitly to the directions of his comm-ander. He
afterwards fell in the battle of Cannae.-—Rufus, consul at Rome
the third year aster Hannibal was banished from Carthago.

Mithridates, is,m., king of Pontus, and the seventh of that name,
was one of the most accomplished and warlike princes that ever
filled a throne. He was the inveterate enemy of the Romans,
of whom he ordered &0900 to be massacred in one night through-
out his dominions. The Mithridatio war, which continued with
few in2ervals for thirty yearS, is one of the most important record-
ed in the annals of Rome. It was successively carried on by
Sylla, Muraena, Lucullus, and Pompey. The latter forced Mith-
ridates, after many disasterS, to take refuge in Scythia, where he
was meditating an invasion of Italy, in imitation of Hannibal,
when his army mutinied, and transferred the command to Phar-
naceS, his son. Seeing himself thus abandoned and betrayed by
his own children, he terminated his life by poison. The joy which

-his death· occasioned at Rome was equal to the terror' which his
arms had inspired.
