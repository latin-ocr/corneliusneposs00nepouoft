DroN, cn. 11. 225

EXERCISE.

Cimon, the son of Miltiades, was married to his own
sister, Elpin1ce by name. He says that he will not suf-
ser the name of the tyrant to be protected by his [i. e.
the speaker's] popularity. His duties as ambassador are
so faithfully executed by Dion, that the tyrant's most
cruel name is protected by his popularity. It cannot be
dcnied that Dionysius is much influenced by the advice
of Dion. How few are there (Pr. Intr. 477), who un·
dertake the post of ambassador with active-readiness,
and execute its duties with fidelity. Though Dionysius
was much influenced by Dion's advice, yet in this mat
ter, his oivn private feeling was stronger.
