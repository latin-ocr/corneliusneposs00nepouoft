Bur littie has been done to this edition save to add
Notes on the Lives from Epaminondas (XV), and
onwards. A Lexicon has also been added, which is
believed to be accurate. A Historical and Geographi-
cal Index completes the additions which have been
made. It is proper to state that the editor of the first
edition of this work is not responsible for the addi-
tions now made. They have been added owing to the
pressing desire of teaehers to possess the complete
work. These additions will be found to be improve-
ments, aud serve to render the work as nearly perfect
as the plan submitted permitted.
