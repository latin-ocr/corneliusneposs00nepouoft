EXERCISE.

This I warn you, to compel Lysander either to fight,
or to terminate the war by some amicable adjustlnent.
He admonished me to protract the war as much as pos·
sible. The king being [now] exhausted has nothing
left but his naval camp. He admonished him to lie a
anchor with his fleet at [the mouth of] ‘ th e G o at ³ s
river.’ Lysander’s present object is to terminate the
war by an amicable adjustment. If Seuthes drives the
Lacedaemonians from the land they will be obliged
either to fight [a battle] or to beg for peace. If any
missortune happens, I shall have no share whatever in
the matter.
