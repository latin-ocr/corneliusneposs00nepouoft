I doubt whether fortune has not more power in this
matter, than the ability of the general. Of his friends
some were banished‚ others executed. I doubt whether
they are not going to confiscate their property, and di-
vide it among themselves. These things are common
to Alcibiades and Thrasybulus. I doubt whether he is
going to proclaim war against the king. It was the
good fortune of Thrasybulus to be, not. only the first,
but the only person, who freed Athens from her most
detestable tyrants. Alcibiades, by a sort of natural tact,

made it appear, that it was he alone, who had set his
country free.
