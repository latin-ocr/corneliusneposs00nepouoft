to his memor-y.

Ilm-aclides, is, m., a native of Syracuse, who, after the expulsion of
the younger Dionysius from Sicily, raised a faction against Dion,
in whose hands the sovereign power was lodged. He was put to
death by Dion's command—a circumstance which contributed in
no small degree to alienate from Dion the affections of the Syra-
cusans.

Hercules, is, m„ the most celebrated horo of antiquity for his strength
and achievements, was the son of Jupiter and Alcmena. Of his
exnloits, which are too numerous to be here detailed, the most re-
markable were, the twelve labors imposed on him by Eurystheus,

> king of Mycenae, viz.: lst‚ to kill a large lion in the Nemean
wood-Qd, to destroy a hydra, or water-snake, of immense size,
in the lake Lerna: this monster had seven heads, and no sooner
was one cut off, than others sprung up in its place—3d, to catch
or slay the huge boar of Erymanthus in Arcadia—arth, to catch
or kill the brazen-footed stag on Mount Menelaus—5th, to destroy
or drive away the birds called Stymphalides, which fed 011 human
flesh—ssth, to cleanse the stables of AugeUS‚ king of Elis, which,

bank than he attempted to bear her away by force. Hercules
ehot au arrow and mortally wounded him. The centaur, when
expiring, gave Dejanira his tunic, stained with blood and poison,
telling her that it had the power to reclaim the wandering affec-

poisoned tunic to Hercules, who, on putting it on, was seized
with such pains (the tunic sticking so close to his skin that it
