[1] 1-6, No n du bito has two meanings: ‘I doubt not .·’ ‘ 1
do not hesitatess (a) Non dubito (I doubt not) is in Cicero (and I
believe Caesar) always followed by quin .· but tho younger Cicero
in one letter, ad Div. xvi. 21, 2, has acc. with inf. (gratos tibi opta-
tosque esse—non dubito). In this sense C. Nepos has always the
acc. and inf.; which also is not uneommon in Livy, Curtius, &c
(b) Iu the sense of ‘ I do not kesitate,’ the inf. is the reg. constr„
but even here Cic. has sometimes quin. [See Z. ᾧ 54η.

After nemini dubium esse C. Nep. has quin in Hann. 2. 6.

7. Ρ l eri q u e ‚ ‘ agreat many‚’ is not a partitive (and therefore not
followed in the best writers by a gen.¹) : it expresses a large number as
forming· a whole ; not as the larger part of a whole. Plurimi is either
‘ very many' (considered as a whole) or ‘ the greatest number: ‘ the
most! Plurimi says more than plerique; and plerique more than
complures (Faus. 2, 2). D.—See Ded. plerique. 8. h o e g e n us

⁸ Cicero, however. pro Cluent. 42, 117, has plerique vestrum sciunt, and de
Amicit. ΞΟ, 71, quorun plerique, and elsewhere the genitive with plerique.—-See
slso Z. ᾗ 109, Note.
