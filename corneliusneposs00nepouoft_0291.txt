xxm-3. Pridie Calendas Aprilis, “the day before the cal-
ends of April, i. e. on the 3lst of March.” Somewhat similar to the
Olympiade of the Greeks, were the Lustra of the Romans. At the
end of every five yearS, a censu-5, or review of the people, was made
which was closed with a solemn sacrifice, called Lustrum. Thia
word, accordingly, is put for the term of five years—thus duo lustra,
ten years3 decem lustra vidit, he is fifty years of age. These Lustra,
however, were not, like the Olympiads, used in reckoning dates, but
merely to denote a certain space of time. The method of reckoning
dates among the Romans was by consulships, or from the foundation
of the city Consuls were first elected, 011 the abolitiou of royalty‚ in

Lucio Tarquinio Collatino consulibus, iu the 244th year of Rome
This method of reckoning dates, however, was difficult and uncertain 3
because the consuls frequently died during their office, and were suc-
ceeded by others before the usual time of election. That, therefore,
of computing from the foundation of the city was easier and more
definite. The year was divided by the Romans into twelve mouths.
These months were adapted to the course of the sun, by Julius Caesar,
with the aid of Sosigenes, an astronomer of Alexandria, and distribu-
ted into the number of days still assigned to each. Hence the year
thus divided, is called the Julian, or Solar Year. The months were
divided into three parts, by Kalends, Nones, and Ides. The first day
was called Kalendae (a calando) from a priest calling out to the people
that it was new moon 3 the Ides, which divided the month, derived
their name from the obsolete verb iduare, to divide 3 and the N ones
were so called because, counting inclusively, they were nine days from
the Ides. The Ides generally fell on the l3th of the month, and the
