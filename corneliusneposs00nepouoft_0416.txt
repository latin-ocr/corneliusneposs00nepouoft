Rhodii, orum, m„ the Rhodians, inhabitants of Rhodus.

Rhodus, or 08, i, f., a celebrated island in the AEgean sea, on the
coast of Lycia. It was remarkable for the purity of its atmo-
sphere 3 and was supposed to be peculiarly favored by Phoebus, the
god os the Suu. The colossal statue of Phoebus, made of brass,
was the principal curiosity which it had to boast of. It was the
work of Chares, a native of the island3 and was about 105 feet
high. Rhodes was famous in ancient times for its power by sea.
It is about 125 miles in circumference.

Roma, α’, f.‚ the principal city of Italy, and long mistress of the
world, was founded by Romulus, about 753 years before the
Christian era. It was built on seven hius, called the Palatino,
the Coelian, the Janicufflm, the Aventina, the Viminal, Quirinal,
and Esquiline hills. Conceming the extent os this city, authors
are not agreed 3—Pliny says, that its circumference was twenty
miles3 and it is said to have contained four millions of inhabitants,
——a population three times greater than that of Londou. It had
644 towers on its walls, of which 300 remain; and 37 gates.
Perhaps nothing in Rome was more remarkable than its aque-
ducts, which convey ed water from the distance of many miles,
and were carried over valleyS, supported by brick arches, reared

’ at a prodigious expense. At the foot of the Capitoline hill was
the forum, or place of public business3 between the Palatino and
Aventino hills, the Circus Maximus, a mile in circumference;
and along the Tiber, the Campus Martius, where the Comitia
were held, and where the youth performed their exercises.

Romanus, a, um, adj„ of Rome, Roman.

Romulus, i, 7n., was the grandson of Numitor, king of Alba, who had
been supplanted by his brother Amulius To prevent any dis-
turbanec from the family of Numitor the usurper caused his sons
to be destroyed, and made his daughter Rhea Silvia, or Ilia,a
vestal virgin. Ilia, however, became the mother of twin sons,
whose father, she pretended‚ was the god Mars. Being exposed
by order of Amulius, the insants were saved and brought up by a
shepherd. &Vhen they grew up, having discovered the secret of
their birth, they slew Amulius, and reinstnted Numitor ou tho
throne. They next resolved to build a city in the place where
they had been brought up. To determine which of them should
have the honor of founding the city, they had recourse to omenS,
which proved favorable to Romulus. Remus was soon after
killed, as he leaped in derision over his brother’s walls. Romulus,
invested with the sovereignty of the new city, greatly extended
its territory by conquest3 and growing insolent and oppressiva
through success, he was put to death by the senators. after a
reign of thirty-seven years. The senators gave out that he had
been taken up to heaveu3 and he was thenoeforth worshipped a·
a god under the name of Quirinus.
