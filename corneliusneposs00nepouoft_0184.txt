Alcibiades was indeed among the first of the Atheni-
ans in political ability, but inconstant in every relation
of life. Pausanias was first blamed for having cai-ved
on a golden mpod, that under his command the Persians
were annihilated at Plataea, and that their general him-
self had fallen in that battle. Pausanias is to be blamed
for having carved [upon it.] that he with a not very
numerous army annihilated the Barbarians at Plataea.
The Lacedaemonians are to be praised for having erased
this inscription, and cari-ed [on it] nothing, but that the
Barbarians had been rovted at Plataea by a not very nu-
merous army of Greeks. Two hundred thousand of the
infantry, which consisted of picked men, fell in that
battle. Pausanias is to be blamed for having begun to
create all manner of political confusion [after] ‚he had
annihilated the Persians at Platoea.
