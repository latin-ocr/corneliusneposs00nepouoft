In the preparation οἰ this volume, great care has been taken to adapt it in every
respect to the wauts 01· the young student, to make it a means at the same time ol
advanciug him in a thorough knowledge os Latin, and inspiring him with a desire
sor further acquaintance with the classics of the lauguage. Dr. Spencer has not, uke
some commentators, given au abundance of help on the easy passages, and allowed
the difficult ones to speak for themselves. His notes are on those parts on which
tue pupil wants them, and explain, not only grammatical difficulties, but allusions 01
every kind in the text. A well-drawn sketch of Caesar's life, a map of the region in
which his campaigns were carried on, and a Vocabuhxry, which removes the neces-
sity of using a large dictionary and the waste of time consequent thereon, enhanoe
the valae of the volume in 110 small degree.

Curtius· History os Alexander the Great, though little used in the schools 0¹
this country, in England and on the Continent holds a high place in the estimation
of classica] instructors. The interesting character of its subject, the elegance os it·
style, and the purity of its moral sentiments, ought to place it at least on a par with
Caesar⁴s Commentaries οι· Sallust‘s Histories. The present edition, by the late Pro-
fessor of Latin in Rutgers college, is unexceptionable in typography, convenient in
torm, scholarly and practical iu its notes, aud altogether an admirable text-book 101
elasses preparing for college.

neither too exuberant nor roo meagre, but happily exemplifying the golden mean 2
iesu-able and yet so very difficult of attainment.'’
