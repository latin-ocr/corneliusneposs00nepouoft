The easiest way to become free from the dominion of

power and to the multitude —1 will prevent the advice
of Miltiades from coming to the king’s ears—I don’t

of your power, and punished by your fellow-citizens.-—
Not the kingdom of Darius only, but our own sovereignty
will be extinguished. ——Histiaeus of Miletus prevented
