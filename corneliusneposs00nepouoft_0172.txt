dors of the Athenians and Lacedaemonians, he must pro-

saves me Themistocles prayed [him] not to give him
up, sor it was difficuh, [he said‚] to provide for his own
safety. After Themistocles was landed (partia), the
ship was carried by a violent storm to Naxus. Themis-
tocles being lauded, thanked the captain. I must perish
if I land there.
