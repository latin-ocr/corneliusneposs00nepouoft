'l'hs present work is what its title indicates, strictly an Ollemlorffi and ainis t·
oppiy the methods which have proved so successful in the acquisition of the modern
{suffrages to the study of Ancient Greek, with such differences as the different genius
of the Greek, and the different purposes for which it is studied, suggest. It differs
from the modern Ollendorffs in containing exercises sor reciprocal translation, in
confining them within a smaller compass, and in a more methodical exposition of the
principles of the language.

The leading object of the author was to furnish a book which should serve as nn
cntrodzcciion to the study of Greek, and precede the use of any grammar. It will
therefore be found, although not claiming to embrace all the principles of the Gram-
mar, yet complete in itself, and will lead the pupil, by insensihle gradations, t'rom the
simpler constructions to those which are more complicated and difficult. The excep-
tions, and the more idiomatic forms, it studiously avoids. aiming only to exhibit the
regular and ordinary usages of the language as the proper starting-point for the stu·
dent‘s further rescarches.

In presenting these, the author has aimed to combine the strictest accuracy with
the utmost simplicity of statement. His work is therefore adapted to a younger class
of pupils than have usually engaged in the study of Greek, and will, it is hoped, win
to the acquisition of that noble tongue many in our academies and primary school·
who have been reuelled by the less simple character of our ordinary text-books.

These Exercises consist of easy sentences, similar to those in the Anabasss, 12
having the same words and construetions, and are designed by frequent repetition to
make the Iearner familiar with the language of Xenophon. Accordingly, the chap-
ters and sections in both are made to correspond. No exercises can be more improv-
lng than those in this volume: obliging the student as they do, by analysis and syn-
thesis, to master the constructione employed by one os the pnrest of Greek writer&
ud imbumg him with the spirit of one of the vreatest historiens of all anfflqulty.
