PREFACE.

 

Tm: English edition of this little work was accom-
panied by the following brief announcement:

“ Shoqu the plan and execution of this little volume
meet with the approbation-of able instructors, it will
probably be followed by a similar one on selected por-
tions of Xenophon’s works.

“For the answers to the questions I am principally
indebted to the excellent editions of Cornelius Nepos
by Bremz, Dc'ilme, and Jaumann.

“ ernox, Jan. 31, 1845. Τ· K· Α-”

In' this American edition the alterations will be found
to consist principally in a more full and correct citation
of illustrative passages, in frequent references to the
recent reprint of Zumpt’s Latin Grammar, to confirm
or silently modify the positions taken, and in the addi-
tion of the notes at the foot of the page, which are re-
ferred to by letters of the alphabet.

Many other changes have been made in the correc-
tion of errors, which appear to have been the conse-
quence of haste, of which it is hoped this edition will
be comparatively free.

With these brief statements of what the editor is
responsible for, he leaves this little volume to win for
itself, both with teachers and pupils, the favor which
it deserves.
