but he has preferred making the reference indefinite and as a thought

of Lysander’s in the first case, and definite, as an historical fact re-

and ac are comparative, nisi exclusive—Nihil aliud nisi approaches to the
meaning ot'lzoc unum : nihil aliud quam to that of idem :’‘ yet he himself makes
our passage: hoc unum molitus esa—:ee Z. §s 7:35.
