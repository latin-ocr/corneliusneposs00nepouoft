roused their fellow-citizens to oppose them. Demosthenes, that
he might not fall into their hands, swallowed poison, in the sixtieth
year of his age, B. c. 324. ·

DercyllztS, i, m.‚ a governor of Attica under Antipater.

Diana, ae,f., the daughter of Jupiter and Latona, and twin-sister os
Apollo. She was the goddess of woods and of hunting. As
Apollo presided over the day, and in that capacity was distin-
guished under the name of Phoebus, or Sol, so Diana ruled in the
heavens by night, and was then distinguished by the nameus
Luna. Her empire extended even to the infernal abodeS, where
she was known by the name of Hecate. Hence she is called by
the poets, tergemina, diva triformis. Her statues were generally
erected where three ways met3 from which circumstance she
sometimes received the appellation of Trivia. She is represented
as a tall beautiful virgin, with a bow or javelin in her right hand,
and a quiver on her shoulder, chasing deer or other wild animals.

Dinon, onis, m., a historian who wrote a history of Persia, in the reign
of Alexander the Great.

Diomedon, ontis, m., a native of Cyzicus, who attempted to bribe
Epaminondas.

Dion, onis, m„ a Syracusani, son of HipparinuS, nearly related to the

two tyrauts of Syracuse, Dionysius the elder, and the younger.
He was a scholar, and ardent admirer of Plato, whom, at his
desire, Dionysius invited to his court. Having become obnoxious
to the tyrant, he was banished to Corinth, where he collected a
powersul army, and was soon able to dethrone Dionysius. He
was soon afterwards betrayed and assassiuated by one of his in·
timate acquaintances, named Callicrates, or CallipuS, in the fifty-
fifth year of his age. His death was universally lamented by the
Syracusans, who raised a monument to his memory.

Dionysius, i, m., (l‚) or the elder, a Syracusan, son of Hermocrates
Having signalized himself in the wars which the Syracusana·
carried on against the Carthaginians, he became very popular
with the army, and availed himself os the power which he had
thus aequired, to establish himself in the sovereignty. His cruelty
rendered him odious to his subjects‚ of whom he became so sus-
picions as to be in perpetual alarin. Among other precautions
which he used to secure himself against their machinatione, he
caused a subterraneous cave to be formed in a rock, in the shape
of a human ear, which measured eighty feet in height, and two
hundred and fifty in length.-—Sounds uttered in this cave were
all conveyed to one common tympanum, which communicated
with an adjoining room, where Dionysius spent the most of his
time to hear what was said by the unhuppy victims of his sus-
picion, whom he had confined in the apartments above. ‘This
cave was called the ear of Dionysius. The artists who were
employed in building it are said to have been put to death by
order of the tyrant, lest they should reveal to what purposes a
work of such uncommon construction was to be appropriated.
He died in the sixty-third year of his age, B. c. 368, after a reign
of thirty-eight years.

Dionysius, i, m., (29 the son of the elder Dionysius, succeeded hia
