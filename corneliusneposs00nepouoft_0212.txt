by [order of] the Ephori. Pharnabazus in an important
letter, written at great length, extols Lysander to the
skies. After I have said (Diff. 98.) what I wish [to
say‚] before the first magistrates‚I shall hand in, by
way of testimonial, the letter written by Pharnabazus.

order Lysander to withdraw. After the Ephori had
[attentively] read the letter, which was put into their
hands by Lysander (partia), they gave it him to read
