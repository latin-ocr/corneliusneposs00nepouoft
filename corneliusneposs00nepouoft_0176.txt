I admire his greatness of mind. We admire the
greatness of mind [that characterizes] such men. The-
mistocles addresses the king with much greater readiness
and fluency than this man can, who was born in Persia.
If you choose to follow my counsels, you will conquer
Greece. Themistocles returned to Magnesia with great
presents bestowed upon him by the king. I will present
you with this city, to supply you with bread. The king
promised to give Themistocles the city of Lampsacus,
from which to supply himself with wine. There are
[still] remaining in our days two monuments to Themis-
tocles. C. Nepos says that Themistocles died at Mag-
nesia of [some] disease : though he allows that his
bones were privately buried in Attica by his friends. I
despair of being able to make good what I have prom-
ised the king with reference to the conquest of Greece.
I fear that you will not be able to make good what you
have promised the king. [Regin with rel. clause. See
Pr. Intr. i. 30.]
