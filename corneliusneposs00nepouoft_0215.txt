ALCIBIADES, CH. 11. 197

EXERCISE.

Of all his contemporaries Alcbiades adaptet] himself
the most dexterously to the times. In Alcibiades nature
seems to have tried, how great a difference there can be
in the same individual. Alcibiades, than whom nobody
was more extraordinary whether in [his] virtues or in
[his] vices, had a talent¹ for business of every kind, and
was full of ability. Cicero was by far the most eloquent
man of his age. Nobody could oppose Cicero in orator-y
[with success] Alcibiades was by sar the most princely
of all his contemporaries both in his pul lic and private
life. Ι sor my part2 have unbent rnyself, nor is there
[any] reason, why I should undergo such labors.
