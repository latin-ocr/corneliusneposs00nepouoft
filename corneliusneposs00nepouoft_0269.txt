DATAMES, cn. vn. vm. 251

EXERCISE ΟΝ CH. V. VI.

Artaxerxes does not blame himself, but sends him
written directions [to leave] this great war [and] pro-
ceed to an inconsiderable affair. How few there are

of the courtiers the more, because the king had ordered
that he should share the command [chap. 3, end] with
Pharnabazus. You will be in great danger, if any thing
goes wrong in Egypt, while you have the command.
There is no doubt that you will have for your bitterest
enemy the man, whose advice the king principally fol-
lows. WVritten orders were sent him by the king, to

Nothing shall hinder me from preparing the Egyptians
o resist.
