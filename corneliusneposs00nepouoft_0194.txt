[3] 3. Α verbal subst. of the fourth declension, occurring only in
the abl. 4. Yes: Timoth. 3, l, hic quum esset magno natu,-
and Dat. 7, 1, Scismas, maximo natufilius. 5. Yes: Liv. 10,
38, G: sacerdote Ovio Pactio quodam, homine magno natu. 6
In: major natu, maximus natu, grandior natu. 7. Yes.

[5] 1. It should be regularly quo hos¹; sor iu an elliptical sen-
tence of this kind the subject is placed in Latin in the accusativo
(not in the nom. to the verb understood) if the subject of thr· other
sentence is in the acc. (with infi). Thus: ‘ they say that Plato felt
the same as Pythagoras [felt] 3’ Plato η e m serunt—sensisse idem,
quod P y t lz ago r a m :—not Pythagoras. C. Tusc. 1, 17. See
Pr. Intr. ii. Cant. 15. Z. (5 603, (α). 9. Α considerable distance²‚
but yet generally within sight: opp.juxta, Ded. 3. Yes: Ipse
enim Thucydides si p ο s t e riu s suisset. Brut. 83, 288. 4.
Animam deponere. Han. 1, 3.

¹ Of course it is a slight irregularity to say, cujus mortui corpus—quo Izi,
instead oscujus mortui corpus—quo horum corpor-tm or quem mortuum—quo Izi:
but this is a sort os thing that occurs in all languages. (Bremi.)

‘² Bremi doubts whether the meaning is that he was buried ⁴ at some distance
from tlte place where lze died,' or ‘at some distance from tlte place where malefac-
εστ-ε were buried’ (quo 1ιί inferuntur qui ad supplicium essent dati) : eo scilicet
loco,q1to erat mortuus. He prefers the former with good reason; though he
says Nep. must then have taken the account, not from Thucydides, but srom
some other authority. Thucydides's words (1, 13⁴) are καὶ αὐτὸν ἐμέλλησαν
μὲν ἔς τὸν Καιᾶδαν, οὗπερ τοῦς κακούργους, ἐμβάλλειν, ’ἔπειτα ἔδοξε πλησίον
που κατορύξαι. Does the πλησίον που mean somewhere near where Ιιε died ,7-
or samem-ltere near tlte Caeadas :2 1f the former, Nep. agrees with Thucydides,

and his use of inferri—infoderunt (in exact correspondence with ἐμβάλλειν-
κατορύξαι) proves him to have had the passage before his eyes· Is it not pos-
sible thata mmor haud has been omitted before procul? though procul and

mov που are not contradictor-y, according to Daderlein's explanation οἲ
