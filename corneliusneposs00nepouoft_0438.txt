A handsome and convenient edition of this great classic, really adaptet] toth
§fauts of schools. has long been needed3 the want is here met by Professor Boise in a
manner that leaves nothing to be desired. Decidedly the best German editions,
whether text or commentary be considered, have appeared within the last few years:
and of these ΜΓ. Boise has made free use; while, at the same time, he has not lost
sight of the fact that the classica} sehools of this country are behind those of Ger-
many, and that simpler and more elementary explanations are therefore often neces-
sary in a work prepared for American schools. Nothing has been put in the notes
,οι- the sake of a mere display of learning‚—-—pedantry is out of place in a school-book3
and nothing has been introduced by way of comment except what can be turned to
practieal use by the render.

An historical introductiom which will enable the pupil to enter on his task intel-
ligently, is prefixed. An abundance of geographical information, embodying the
latest discoveries of travellers, is supplied3 and the whole is illustratcd with Kio-
perfs excellent map, showing the entire route of the ten thousand on their retreat.

This will be found an exceedingiy useful book for College classes. The text 1³
large and distinct, the typography accurate, and the notes judicious and scholarly.
Instead of referring the student to a variety of books, few of which are within his
reach, the editor has wisely supplied whatever is necessary. An admirable treatise
on the Life of Socrates introduces tho work5 and English and Greek Indexes render
Η easy to refer to the text and notes.

From Phor. nmmos, Universz'ty of Virqz’nia.

‘⁴ I'he Notos contain. in much detail, the grammatica] and other explanation*
which it would be convenient sor the lem-ner to have placed before him, instead of
tevine to refer to various books. I have no doubt that the Notes me very caretum
prepared, and in accordance with the best authorities,”
